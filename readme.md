## List of bibliographies
### babylon-bibliography
The Babylon-Bibliography is a project directed by Olof Peders√©n and Eva Cancik-Kirschbaum. Raija Mattila, Helsinki, did most of the original collection of references. Later Felix Levenson, Berlin, made structural changes to the material. The bibliographical information is available as Open Access. (also compare http://babylon-online.org/babylon-projekt/repositories/bibliography/bibliography/references)


## Usage
Every Bibliography is downloadable and usable in two ways:
* As Word-Doc`.rtf`-file exported with the style 'American Journal of Archaeology'
* As `.json`, to import it in your favorit Citation-Management-Program (e.g. Zotero).
